# Chocolate Factory üç´

### Approach

My approach to building the Chocolate Factory was driven by simplicity and user-friendliness. We opted for a vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript stack to keep things straightforward and beginner-friendly. No external frameworks or libraries were used to ensure a lightweight and understandable codebase.

### Tools and Frameworks

1. **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: The trifecta of web development formed the backbone of our project. This choice aimed to provide a solid foundation for learners and those new to web development.

2. **FontAwesome**: We integrated FontAwesome to easily include stylish icons in our project, making the interface visually appealing and enhancing the overall user experience.

### Reasoning

1. **Simplicity**: The core principle of this project is simplicity. We wanted to create a clear and understandable codebase, making it accessible for those learning web development.

2. **Vanilla Stack**: By avoiding external libraries or frameworks, we prioritize the fundamentals. This decision allows users to grasp the basics of web development without the complexities introduced by additional tools.

3. **User-Friendly Design**: The clean and intuitive design ensures that users can navigate through the Chocolate Factory effortlessly. From selecting chocolates to managing their cart, the user interface aims to provide a delightful experience.

## Project Structure

The project is structured with clean HTML for the main content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic interactions. The HTML is organized to create a visually appealing layout, and CSS styles bring life to the elements. JavaScript handles the logic behind adding chocolates to the cart and updating the total cost dynamically.

### HTML Structure

- **Header**: The top section houses the Chocolate Factory logo and a shopping cart icon with a count indicator.
- **Main Container**: The central area consists of a product display section (`#root`) and a sidebar for the shopping cart.
- **Sidebar**: An aside section displays the user's cart items, providing a summary of their chocolate selections.

### CSS Styling

- **Clean Styling**: The styles focus on cleanliness and readability, ensuring a pleasant visual experience for users.
- **Responsive Design**: Media queries are employed to make the website responsive across different devices, promoting accessibility.

### JavaScript Functionality

- **Product Display**: The product array is dynamically rendered on the page, allowing users to view available chocolates.
- **Cart Interaction**: Users can add chocolates to their cart, with the total cost updating dynamically. The cart also has a maximum limit of 8 items.
